"""A pillar agent: query -> embedding -> hybrid -> relevance gate -> rerank.

The pipeline Discover runs for agents (docs/search-flow.md), for any
catalogue. A pillar configures one with what its records are and how each
reads to the reranker, and hands it the records the person may see.

    query       masked by the guardrails before any agent sees it
    embedding   MiniLM, the query as given
    hybrid      Chroma (meaning) and BM25 (exact words), each told what the
                person may see, fused by rank (RRF, k 60)
    gate        kept if close in meaning (0.30, and 65% of the best) or a
                strong keyword hit (half the best keyword score, carrying
                half of the words typed)
    rerank      the model judges every candidate against the request, strong,
                partial or no fit: strong comes before partial, and what does
                not fit is dropped. Skipped below two candidates, when policy
                keeps the request from the model, and on any failure, which
                keeps the fused order
    context     the caller reads each id's record from its source

Permission first and again after: the permitted set filters inside both
retrievers, and nothing outside it survives the gate.
