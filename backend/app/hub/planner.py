"""Understand the request: its intents, objective, job and needs, and what to
ask each pillar's agent.

The model reads every task and plans it. Rules read it too: their plan is the
first reading streamed while the model plans, and the plan whenever the model
may not or cannot be asked (the data policy allows no model call, no model is
configured, or the call fails). Whichever plans, the intents decide which
agents are asked: a single intent is never spread across every pillar.
