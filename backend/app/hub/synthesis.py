"""The reply: written by the model from what the agents found.

Every task's reply is the model's, grounded in the items the agents returned
and the job's toolkit. The catalogue's own sentence is the fallback, used
when there is nothing to write about, when the data policy keeps the request
from the model, when no model is configured, and when the model's reply does
not name something that was actually found or carries a link.
