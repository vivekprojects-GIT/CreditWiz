"""Governance on the plan: deterministic, after the plan and before anything runs.

The guardrails (guardrails.py) settled who may see what and what the model may
receive. This enforces them on what the planner proposed:

    which pillars       only ones this person's hub shows them
    which job           only one of this persona's own
    what each pillar    the request without client details, links or
      is asked          placeholders, and without the words that only chose the pillar
    how sensitive       the stricter of the guardrails and the plan; the model
                        writes the reply only if the policy for that class allows

Every decision that changed something is written down in plain words, so the
answer can say how it was chosen.
