"""Conversation intent gate: small talk answered directly, a task sent on.

Runs after UserContext and before anything that costs: no guardrails, no
model, no search, no vector retrieval. It reads the request as a person would:

    "hy", "hiii", "Hello!", "gm"                 greeting     answered here
    "how r u", "i'm good", "lol", "test"         small talk   answered here
    "thx", "ty", "thank you so much"             thanks       answered here
    "bye", "cya", "that's all"                   goodbye      answered here
    "What can you do?", "who are you"            help         the hub's five capabilities
    "Hi, can you find me a KYC agent?"           task         "find me a KYC agent?" goes on

People greet the way they type: "hy", "hiii", "heyyy there", "helo". The
patterns take stretched and misspelled forms, and a one-word message one
letter from a greeting counts as one. A greeting in front of a request is set
aside, never taken for the request. Deciding is rules, not a model: instant,
free, and exact about what matched.

The reply is natural (natural()): one short model call, streamed, with the
person's name, role and what the conversation was about, and within the same
data policy as any request. No search runs and nothing is recommended. The
fixed replies in answer() are the fallback when no model may or can answer.
