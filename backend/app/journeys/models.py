"""Journeys: what a persona actually does, and what helps at each job.

    persona -> journeys -> steps
                        -> systems of record (where the work really happens)
                        -> asset refs, each tagged with the intent it serves

An asset ref points at the record of truth for that asset: an agent in
agents.json, a learning item in learning.json, or an entry in assets.json for
the kinds that have no pillar of their own yet (systems, data products,
prompts, experts, communities, use cases). Nothing is copied between them.

A request is answered from two contexts kept apart on purpose:

    UserContext  who the person is: role, function, interests, maturity,
                 entitlements (context/models.py, stable across a session)
    TaskContext  what they are doing now: intent, objective, activity,
                 subject, needs, sensitivity (below, built per request)
