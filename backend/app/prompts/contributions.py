"""What people contribute through Create, and where each goes to be found.

    Create -> POST /api/contributions -> contributions table   the record
                                      -> ingest()              its agent's index
                                            prompt, agent proposal -> Prompts & Skills
                                            skill video            -> Learning

The table is the record of truth. An index holds a derived copy, one text
embedded, which reindex() rebuilds from the table at boot. Who may find a
contribution is read from the table on every search, never from an index:

    its author     always, from the moment it is submitted
    anyone else    once approved, within the audience fixed at submission
                   team        the author's desk
                   department  the author's department
                   everyone    everyone signed in to the hub

A prompt's audience is the scope its author chose, except that High risk
keeps it to their desk: the library's own rule for High. Returned work leaves
the index; its author still sees it in My library.
