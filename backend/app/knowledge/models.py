"""The systems and document types that will feed the AI Hub.

    systems          where content lives: wikis, document sites, work tracking
    document types   what the content is: requirements, designs
    link groups      how the team groups its links today

The listing is the MUFG team's own (Swim Lane 1). `feeds` is the hub's
proposal for what each would become in the hub, not an agreed integration.
Nothing is connected in the prototype, and a value the owning team has not
confirmed is left blank rather than guessed.
