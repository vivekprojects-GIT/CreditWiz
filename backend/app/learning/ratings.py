"""Learner star ratings for learning items.

Two averages, on purpose:

`rating_average` is the plain mean, and it is withheld entirely until an item has
`MIN_SHOWN` ratings. On a catalogue this size a mean over one or two votes is
noise presented as fact, and "5.0" from a single rating reads as authoritative.

`rating_weighted` is that mean shrunk toward the catalogue mean. Nothing displays
it today. It exists because it is the value a rating-aware ranker must sort on:
without shrinkage a lone 5.0 outranks a 4.6 earned over forty ratings. Ranking
still ignores ratings entirely -- see learning/router.curation_breakdown.
